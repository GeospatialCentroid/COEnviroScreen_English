Ozone,"Ozone is an air pollutant that can harm the respiratory system and cause asthma attacks, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Ozone forms when chemicals from natural and human-made sources mix in the air. Ozone concentration varies by location, time of year, and time of day."
Particles ,"PM2.5 is a name for tiny particles that can harm the heart and lungs. These particles come from many different sources. Sources include vehicle tailpipes, smokestacks, dust from construction sites, fires, and chemical reactions in the atmospher"
Lead exposure risk,"Lead is a metal that can harm the brain and nervous system. It is especially dangerous for young children and pregnant people. Older homes are more likely to contain lead-based paint and are more likely to have lead water pipes, or lead in water service lines leading to the home."
Traffic proximity and volume,"People who live close to roads with heavy traffic can be exposed to  harmful air emissions, especially PM2.5 (fine particle pollution). They also can be exposed to loud noise."
Diesel PM,"Diesel engines emit a mixture of chemicals called diesel particulate matter or diesel PM. Diesel PM can lead to asthma and respiratory illnesses and can worsen existing heart and lung disease. Diesel PM is highest near freeways, railyards, and other industrial sites where diesel engines are used."
Proximity to National Priorities List (NPL) sites,"The National Priority List (NPL) identifies places like landfills, mines, and industrial sites that have released or could release hazardous substances into the environment. This includes Superfund sites, where federal funds are used for cleanup."
Proximity to RMP Sites,Risk Management Plan (RMP) sites are facilities that use extremely hazardous materials in their work. These facilities must have a risk management plan to prevent and respond to hazardous chemical emergencies.
Wastewater Discharge Indicator,Some chemicals may affect water quality and could pose a risk to human health or the environment. CDPHE regulates industrial facilities that  release byproducts and waste into nearby streams and rivers.
Proximity to Hazardous Waste Facilities,"This indicator shows where hazardous waste is generated, treated, stored, and/or disposed. Some of these sites may be  on the National Priority List for cleanup and/or required to have a risk management plan (RMP). Regulations limit the impacts of hazardous waste on human health and the environment."
Asthma hospitalization rate,Environmental conditions like poor air quality are one of many factors that can trigger asthma attacks and make them more severe. 
Heart disease in adults,"Environmental conditions like air quality, drinking water quality, or extreme heat are some of the many factors that can affect cardiovascular health. "
Low weight birth rate,Environmental conditions like exposure to air toxics are one of many factors that can affect birth weight. 
Percent people of color,"Systemic racism can affect health outcomes, environmental exposures, access to or quality of services, and other social determinants of health for people of color. This indicator represents the demographic make-up of racial and ethnic groups in a community. It includes people who identify as Black (or African-American), Hispanic (or Latino/a/x), Asian, American Indian, Alaska Native, or any other race/ethnicity besides non-Hispanic white. The Environmental Justice Act defines any census block group where 40% or more of the population identify as people of color as a disproportionately impacted community."
Percent low income,"Income is strongly associated with health outcomes, environmental exposures, and access to or quality of services. This indicator describes how many people in a community live at or below twice the federal poverty level. In 2021, this meant an annual income of $53,000 or less for a family of four. The Environmental Justice Act defines any census block group where 40% or more of the population live at or below twice the federal poverty level as a disproportionately impacted community."
Percent linguistic isolation,"Limited English proficiency affects how well people can access services and information in their community, such as public notices about environmental contamination.  Linguistic isolation describes individuals and households that have limited English proficiency or speak languages other than English at home. "
Percent less than high school education,"How much education a person has is associated with health, length of life, and exposure to pollution. People with less education are more likely to be affected by pollution because of where they live or work."
Population under 5,"Harmful pollutants can have a greater impact on children because they have smaller bodies. Some environmental exposures can affect growth and development, much of which occurs under 5 years of age."
Population over 64,"People over 64 years of age are more vulnerable to environmental exposures such as air pollution and extreme heat. They also are more likely to have other conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, that may increase risk from environmental exposures."
Wildfire Risk,"A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire in nature, such as in forests or grasslands. Wildfires affect people’s  physical, mental, and financial health. Wildfires threaten ecosystems and water supplies and produce harmful smoke, which can trigger health problems like asthma or stroke. Climate change increases the risk and severity of wildfires."
Flood Plains,"A floodplain is land near a river or stream that is more likely to flood during heavy storms. Flooding can affect people’s physical, mental, and financial health. Climate change increases the risk and severity of floods."
Percent disability,"This indicator shows how many people in a community have impaired or low vision, are deaf or are hard of hearing, have limited or complete physical mobility, or are experiencing developmental disabilities. These conditions can worsen the effects of environmental or climate hazards"
Air Toxics Emissions,"Air toxics are a group of chemicals, such as  benzene and formaldehyde, that can cause cancer and other serious health impacts. The Clean Air Act sets limits on emissions of these chemicals. Air toxics are sometimes called Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs)."
Other Criteria Pollutants,"Other air pollutants can cause a variety of health impacts, especially if someone breathes in large amounts over short periods of time. These pollutants include sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), large or coarse particulate matter (PM10 or dust), and carbon monoxide (CO).  The Clean Air Act sets health-based limits on how much of these pollutants can safely be in the air. "
Proximity to oil and gas facilities,Oil and gas extraction activities can release air pollutants like benzene. Epidemiological studies have shown that living near these sites can be associated with health impacts. 
Housing Cost-Burdened Communities,High housing costs reduce the amount of money people can spend on products and services that promote health and wellbeing. A household is cost-burdened if it spends more than 30% of its monthly income on rent or a mortgage. The Environmental Justice Act defines any census block group where more than 40% of households are housing cost-burdened as a disproportionately impacted community.
Life Expectancy,Life expectancy is the average number of years a person is expected to live. The average life expectancy in a community reflects its overall health and wellbeing.
